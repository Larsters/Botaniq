## Botaniq

Most plant apps today are simple watering reminders. I want to go deeper — using real weather data, soil conditions, and AI predictions to help users maximize plant growth, health, and yield. Whether it’s basil on your balcony, weed in your closet, or tomatoes in your garden — Botaniq will act like a personal agronomist in your pocket.

## Workflow
1. User provides farm location & basic details
- *Location* - on a map or via GPS
- *Plant type*
- *Soil facts*
- *Fertilizers/ Additives* - which ones they plant to use if any
- *Upload a picture for feedback*

2. System fetches relevant data:
- *Weather* - current and forecasted weather data
- *Soil* - soil conditions, moisture, and nutrients
- *Plant* - plant growth stage, health, and yield predictions
